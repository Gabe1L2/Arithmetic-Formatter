# Scientific Computing with Python - Projects

This repository contains the projects I am working on as part of the **Scientific Computing with Python** certification from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I will update this as I complete them

## Projects Overview

1. **Arithmetic Formatter** - Completed on **1/27/25**
   - **Description**: This project is a simple arithmetic formatter that takes in a list of arithmetic problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and returns them in a well-organized, readable format.
   - **Skills Covered**: String manipulation, formatting, basic arithmetic operations.

2. **Time Calculator** - Completed on **2/16/25**
   - **Description**: A time calculator that takes a start time, a duration, and optionally a starting day of the week, and calculates the new time, handling different days and formatting properly.
   - **Skills Covered**: Date and time manipulation, string formatting, handling edge cases.

3. **Budget App** - Completed on **2/17/25**
   - **Description**: This budget tracker keeps track of personal spending by categorizing transactions as expenses and income, and calculates balances for each category.
   - **Skills Covered**: Lists and dictionaries, data manipulation, financial calculations.

4. **Polygon Area Calculator** - Completed on **2/18/25**  
   - **Description**: A class-based program that models rectangles and squares, allowing for area, perimeter, and diagonal calculations, as well as shape visualization using ASCII art. It also determines how many times one shape can fit inside another.  
   - **Skills Covered**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with class inheritance, algorithmic problem-solving, Method overriding, and polymorphism
