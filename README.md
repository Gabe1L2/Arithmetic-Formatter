# Scientific Computing with Python - Projects

This repository contains the projects I am worked on as part of the **Scientific Computing with Python** certification from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## Projects Overview

1. **Arithmetic Formatter** - Completed on **1/27/25**
   - **Description**: This project is a simple arithmetic formatter that takes in a list of arithmetic problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and returns them in a well-organized, readable format.
   - **Skills Covered**: String manipulation, formatting, basic arithmetic operations.

2. **Time Calculator** - Completed on **2/16/25**
   - **Description**: A time calculator that takes a start time, a duration, and optionally a starting day of the week, and calculates the new time, handling different days and formatting properly.
   - **Skills Covered**: Date and time manipulation, string formatting, handling edge cases.

3. **Budget App** - Completed on **2/17/25**
   - **Description**: This budget tracker keeps track of personal spending by categorizing transactions as expenses and income, and calculates balances for each category.
   - **Skills Covered**: Lists and dictionaries, data manipulation, financial calculations.

4. **Polygon Area Calculator** - Completed on **2/18/25**  
   - **Description**: A class-based program that models rectangles and squares, allowing for area, perimeter, and diagonal calculations, as well as shape visualization using ASCII art. It also determines how many times one shape can fit inside another.  
   - **Skills Covered**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with class inheritance, algorithmic problem-solving, Method overriding, and polymorphism
  
5. **Probability Calculator** - Completed on **2/19/25**
   - **Description**: This project involved simulating random draws from a hat containing different colored balls to estimate probabilities using Monte Carlo methods. The goal was to determine the likelihood of drawing a specified combination of balls over multiple trials.
   - **Skills Covered**: Probability theory, Monte Carlo simulations, random sampling, object-oriented programming (OOP), and algorithm development.
