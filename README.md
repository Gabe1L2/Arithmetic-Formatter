# Scientific Computing with Python - Projects

This repository contains the projects I worked on as part of the **Scientific Computing with Python** certification from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). View my certification [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/gabelee12/scientific-computing-with-python-v7).

## Projects Overview

1. **Arithmetic Formatter** - Completed on **1/27/25**
   - **Description**: This project creates a formatter for simple arithmetic problems. It takes in a list of arithmetic problems (addition and subtraction only), checks for input errors (invalid characters, operator misuse, and invalid number sizes), and then arranges them in a visually appealing way. The program also provides the option to show the answers to the problems after formatting.
   - **Skills Covered**: String manipulation, input validation, error handling, formatting, basic arithmetic operations.

2. **Time Calculator** - Completed on **2/16/25**
   - **Description**: A time calculator that takes a start time, a duration, and optionally a starting day of the week, and calculates the new time, handling different days and formatting properly.
   - **Skills Covered**: Date and time manipulation, string formatting, handling edge cases.

3. **Budget App** - Completed on **2/17/25**
   - **Description**: A budget tracker that allows users to create categories, make deposits, track withdrawals, transfer funds, and visualize spending through a bar chart.
   - **Skills Covered**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), financial calculations, string formatting, and data visualization.

4. **Polygon Area Calculator** - Completed on **2/18/25**  
   - **Description**: A class-based program to calculate area, perimeter, diagonal, and the number of times one shape fits inside another. The program supports both rectangles and squares.  
   - **Skills Covered**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with class inheritance, algorithmic problem-solving, Method overriding, and polymorphism
  
5. **Probability Calculator** - Completed on **2/19/25**
   - **Description**: This project involved simulating random draws from a hat containing different colored balls to estimate probabilities using Monte Carlo methods. The goal was to determine the likelihood of drawing a specified combination of balls over multiple trials.
   - **Skills Covered**: Probability theory, Monte Carlo simulations, random sampling, object-oriented programming (OOP), and algorithm development.
